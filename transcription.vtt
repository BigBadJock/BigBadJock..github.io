00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.760
Excellent.
<00:02:02.240>excellent 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.280
That sounds good.
<00:02:02.760>that <00:02:02.880>sounds <00:02:03.120>good 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.480

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.920
Run a bit longer over here.
<00:02:07.480>run <00:02:07.600>a <00:02:08.000>bit <00:02:08.120>longer <00:02:16.480>over <00:02:16.680>here 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.020
Although this is one of the one of the participants over here, this is another participant.
<00:02:09.220>although <00:02:09.380>this <00:02:09.740>is <00:02:09.900>one <00:02:10.100>of <00:02:10.180>the <00:02:10.500>one <00:02:10.700>of <00:02:10.780>the <00:02:10.860>participants <00:02:11.500>over <00:02:11.780>here <00:02:14.860>this <00:02:15.060>is <00:02:15.220>another <00:02:15.540>participant 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.080
Your AI is going to struggle to tell the difference.
<00:02:18.000>your <00:02:18.280>AI <00:02:18.440>is <00:02:18.520>going <00:02:18.680>to <00:02:18.760>struggle <00:02:19.160>to <00:02:19.240>tell <00:02:19.480>the <00:02:19.560>difference 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.640
Well, it depends.
<00:02:21.840>well <00:02:22.080>it <00:02:22.160>depends 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:38.760
If I get separate recordings, then I'll be doing each of them separately and merging merging the transcriptions, which will be interesting.
<00:02:22.640>if <00:02:22.920>i <00:02:22.960>get <00:02:23.160>separate <00:02:23.600>recordings <00:02:25.520>then <00:02:25.760>i'll <00:02:25.880>be <00:02:26.000>doing <00:02:26.400>each <00:02:26.640>of <00:02:26.760>them <00:02:27.000>separately <00:02:29.240>and <00:02:29.440>merging <00:02:30.440>merging <00:02:30.920>the <00:02:31.000>transcriptions <00:02:37.760>which <00:02:37.960>will <00:02:38.080>be <00:02:38.200>interesting 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.200
Album the my File Manager.
<00:02:40.120>album <00:02:41.560>the <00:02:42.280>my <00:02:42.440>file <00:02:42.680>manager 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.360
I used one called Dolphin and it has it's you can have split pane, SO2 panes and then tabs as well.
<00:02:43.200>i <00:02:43.360>used <00:02:44.120>one <00:02:44.320>called <00:02:44.520>dolphin <00:02:45.480>and <00:02:45.840>it <00:02:45.960>has <00:02:47.080>it's <00:02:47.720>you <00:02:47.880>can <00:02:48.000>have <00:02:48.160>split <00:02:48.480>pane <00:02:49.080>so <00:02:49.240>two <00:02:49.440>panes <00:02:49.960>and <00:02:50.080>then <00:02:50.240>tabs <00:02:50.960>as <00:02:51.120>well 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.520
So I normally have loads of tabs to different pairs of panes and it's forgotten them all.
<00:02:51.360>so <00:02:51.520>i <00:02:51.560>normally <00:02:51.840>have <00:02:52.000>loads <00:02:52.400>of <00:02:52.480>tabs <00:02:53.280>to <00:02:53.520>different <00:02:54.080>pairs <00:02:54.480>of <00:02:54.600>panes <00:02:56.080>and <00:02:56.400>it's <00:02:56.680>forgotten <00:02:57.080>them <00:02:57.240>all 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:09.920
Yeah, that sounds good.
<00:02:58.320>yeah <00:03:09.320>that <00:03:09.440>sounds <00:03:09.720>good 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.280
Just annoying when it does that, so and also the pane can be local or remote as well, which is the very cool bit.
<00:02:58.920>just <00:02:59.200>annoying <00:02:59.760>when <00:02:59.920>it <00:03:00.040>does <00:03:00.240>that <00:03:02.080>so <00:03:03.360>and <00:03:03.520>also <00:03:04.000>the <00:03:04.120>pane <00:03:04.480>can <00:03:04.640>be <00:03:04.760>local <00:03:05.120>or <00:03:05.240>remote <00:03:05.880>as <00:03:06.040>well <00:03:06.160>which <00:03:06.360>is <00:03:06.480>the <00:03:06.560>very <00:03:06.760>cool <00:03:07.000>bit 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.280
So yeah, I can grab these recordings now.
<00:03:07.440>so <00:03:13.760>yeah <00:03:14.720>i <00:03:14.840>can <00:03:15.000>grab <00:03:15.280>these <00:03:15.480>recordings <00:03:16.040>now 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:20.320
