WEBVTT - transcription

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.880
Hello amigo, this is the.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.160
Dev.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.720
IVR.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.800
Please say your name after the tone recording started.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.640
Steve, line one.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:24.960
You are currently the only person in this conference has entered the conference.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.000
Hello, see if I can make this happen as well.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.920
Yeah, sure.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600
This this could be an interesting test.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.320
This might work.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.120
Actually it looks like it's going to it's going to add an extra line to it.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:58.880
Please say your name after the tone Steve.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.880
Yeah.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:06.640
So please find 2.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.720
Line 2 recording starts to Mella.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.920
Has entered the conference.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.520
OK, so I still don't see any recording started, but let's see if it's putting it in the other the older location it may just have ignored.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.160
Yeah.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.640
July is the 17th.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.800
It has a directory structure that goes year and then inside that month inside that day.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.000
It has a directory structure that goes here that that day.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.140
Interesting.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.250
Interesting.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:02:00.120
We do seem to have a number of recordings already and yeah, 33 recordings that are growing constantly, which bodes well for three participants in the chat.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:54.520
We do have number of recording and yeah, they're growing.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.300
Yeah, I let it run for a little bit longer.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.760
Excellent.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.280
That sounds good.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.480
Let it.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.920
Run a bit longer over here.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.020
Although this is one of the one of the participants over here, this is another participant.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.080
Your AI is going to struggle to tell the difference.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.640
Well, it depends.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:38.760
If I get separate recordings, then I'll be doing each of them separately and merging merging the transcriptions, which will be interesting.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.200
Album the my File Manager.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.360
I used one called Dolphin and it has it's you can have split pane, SO2 panes and then tabs as well.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.520
So I normally have loads of tabs to different pairs of panes and it's forgotten them all.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:09.920
Yeah, that sounds good.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.280
Just annoying when it does that, so and also the pane can be local or remote as well, which is the very cool bit.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.280
So yeah, I can grab these recordings now.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:20.320
I'll tell you what, let's keep it short and yeah, and stick them on the share and I'll see what I can get from them.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.560
Cheers.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.360
OK.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.120
Bye bye.
