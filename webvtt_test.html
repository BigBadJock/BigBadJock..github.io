        <p>Hello amigo, this is the.</p>
        <p>Dev IVR Please say your name after the tone recording started.</p>
        <p>Steve, line one.</p>
        <p>You are currently the only person in this conference has entered the conference.</p>
        <p>Hello, see if I can make this happen as well.</p>
        <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        <p>This this could be an interesting test.</p>
        <p>This might work.</p>
        <p>Actually it looks like it's going to it's going to add an extra line to it.</p>
        <p>Please say your name after the tone.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>So.</p>
        <p>Steve Line 2.</p>
        <p>Recording start 2 OK, so I still don't see any recording started, but let's see if it's putting it in the
            other, the older location it may just have ignored.</p>
        <p>Please find.</p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p>Has entered the conference.</p>
        <p>The cause of the star if if they're doing it in any other the older locations, it has a directory structure
            that goes here that that day interesting we do have number of recording.</p>
        <p>July is the 17th.</p>
        <p>It has a directory structure that goes year and then inside that month, inside that day.</p>
        <p>Interesting.</p>
        <p>We do seem to have a number of recordings already and yeah, 33 recordings that are growing constantly, which
            bodes well for three participants in the chat.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I let it run for a little bit longer.</p>
        <p>Excellent.</p>
        <p>That sounds good.</p>
        <p>Let it.</p>
        <p>Run a bit longer over here.</p>
        <p>Although this is one of the one of the participants over here, this is another participant.</p>
        <p>Your AI is going to struggle to tell the difference.</p>
        <p>Well it depends if if I get separate recordings then I'll be doing each of them separately and merging
            merging the transcriptions which will be interesting, no?</p>
        <p>Cool yes album the my File Manager I used one called Dolphin and it has it's you can have split pane SO2
            panes and then tabs as well.</p>
        <p>So I normally have loads of tabs to different pairs of panes and it's forgotten them all.</p>
        <p>Just annoying when it does that.</p>
        <p>So and also the pane can be local or remote as well, which is the very cool bit.</p>
        <p>So yeah, I can grab these recordings now.</p>
        <p>Oh, sounds good.</p>
        <p>I'll tell you what, let's keep it short and Yep and stick them on the share and I'll see what I can get from
            them.</p>
        <p>Brilliant.</p>
        <p>OK, I'll speak to your.</p>
        <p>Cheers.</p>
        <p>OK.</p>
        <p>Bye bye.</p>
