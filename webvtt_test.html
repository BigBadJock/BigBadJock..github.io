        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>Hello, how are you doing?</p>
        <p>Hi, John.</p>
        <p>That's about how Are you sure?</p>
        <p>Not so bad.</p>
        <p>I just thought we if we have a sort of random conversation rather than a scripted 1 because that has more
            gaps and Ms
            and OS than than than a scripted 1.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, Yeah, I was, Yeah.</p>
        <p>So just I was just, if you could chat about anything really.</p>
        <p>Go ahead.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>I mean, just on the topic of, of putting a script together, I, I was, I put together a table.</p>
        <p>Let me share it with you in the chat.</p>
        <p>I've got it in my Notion document, but allow me to to screenshot it.</p>
        <p>So I was thinking something like what's on your screen at the moment, One key to back would be good.</p>
        <p>Like I created the matrix where it's 3 essentially 3 different topics of conversation and it's repeated
            between three
            different caller groups, so different voices.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And then it's repeated to have the same same conversation but the tone of it is negative and the topic of it
            is a
            little bit switched around.</p>
        <p>So for example, there could be a development discussion between 2 developers.</p>
        <p>The first one could be like them agreeing on the best way forward and agreeing on due date for task.</p>
        <p>And then the flipped version of that is a disagreement between 2 developers couldn't come to an agreement and
            just
            see how it handles the two variations.</p>
        <p>So maybe when Keith is back, we can kind of put together some recordings for that, that matrix of how many
            calls
            there 12312363 by 6 or 1818 voice recordings there.</p>
        <p>It's quite a lot, but that only makes sense once you've kind of automated your your pipeline flow a little
            bit, so
            you don't have to keep their manual steps.</p>
        <p>Yeah, well, at the moment, well, Steve, still he's not time to work out how to to get the conversation ID so
            we can
            attach it to the recording.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I mentioned that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And I've also just had a play around with the Fusion PBXAPI.</p>
        <p>Again, it's definitely not giving me a list of recordings, which is really annoying.</p>
        <p>So I don't know how we it should.</p>
        <p>But it but it it should, it's not giving something it should.</p>
        <p>Yeah, OK.</p>
        <p>No, it's just I'm getting a 200 back from the call, but no, no data.</p>
        <p>But then it it quite often gives a 200 back from the call anyway, even if it's an invalid call, which is a
            bit
            annoying.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>So it's definitely something that we might need to talk to them about to see if there's an issue.</p>
        <p>OK.</p>
        <p>One thing that that Simon did did mention he wants us doing is, is talking to Fusion directly and building
            the
            conversa relationship with them.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>So that's probably something I'm gonna be more, more, more pushed by Simon.</p>
        <p>I might try give them a bail later or Or you can just e-mail them, no?</p>
        <p>There was an API which Paul mentioned, Notes API, don't know if we came across that previously when you were
            looking
            at Fusion.</p>
        <p>So look, look pretty good.</p>
        <p>I only looked at it very superficially, but apparently Paul, Paul's watched a few videos on him and it's
            basically
            it's around talking to Fusion and they streamline a lot of lot of things in that space.</p>
        <p>So Paul kind of asked the question is, can this help us in any way?</p>
        <p>And I said, and I promise that we'll look into it.</p>
        <p>It might might even be that you know, you, you might find that there's no reason to use their API to build a
            platform, but it might be an interim step where OPS can use and points through Postman very quickly using
            the API to
            make changes.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>That's something that he was keen about.</p>
        <p>So setting up, yeah, well, I think the feeling was like, without looking into in detail, I can't answer it.
        </p>
        <p>I mean, if it's only for a couple of particular queries and depending on how the data is getting stored,
            they're
            using a Postgres database.</p>
        <p>So I mean, I could always write an API myself that, that that goes into the post.</p>
        <p>You know, if it's, if it's, if it's just a couple of extra things which which the standard one doesn't give
            us.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>But the kind of the question that Paul asked is obviously there's so much that OPS want to do to replicate
            the
            current setup and that's going to take your time to build and for us to put it in the portal.</p>
        <p>But if they are able to use this through Postman to very quickly make changes to, to, to fusion, you know,
            set up in
            groups or make changes to extension, then is there a possibility of doing that while we write our own APIs
            and then
            connect it up to the portal?</p>
        <p>So there's worth exploring at some point next week.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I'll have a look.</p>
        <p>Did you, did you chat me the the name of it or was it in it?</p>
        <p>So it's in that it's in the fusion document that I pushed out in the dev chat earlier in the week, which,
            yeah, yeah.
        </p>
        <p>Was it in an e-mail?</p>
        <p>Yes, Yeah, I, I, I remember seeing it somewhere.</p>
        <p>So there's some detail in that and I'll mention it to Keith tomorrow as well.</p>
        <p>So it's in the future I'll have, I'll have a look at that then.</p>
        <p>So I hope might bring it out.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>I'm quite annoyed the the the call recording list one's not working because if I have the name of the of the
            file I
            can the the I can download it using the API, it's just not letting me get a list of them.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Is there anything that needs to be configured that that we've missed maybe?</p>
        <p>So it's a sort of, I don't, I don't think so.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yep.</p>
        <p>So yeah, it would be good to I'll have, I'll have a look at the the extra API.</p>
        <p>But it would it's it's quite annoying that the API is not working.</p>
        <p>So I will try reaching out to Fusion and see seeing if they can tell me where I'm going wrong because I'm
            basically
            copying the the exact call that's in the example and it's not working, which is annoying.</p>
        <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, Skip, there is.</p>
        <p>But yeah, that aside, it's, it's pretty good.</p>
        <p>I don't know if you keep sharing it with you, but there was a PBX forum specifically around Fusion where
            people were
            posting questions.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I've, yeah, I've had to look on that.</p>
        <p>There's, there's no, there's nothing about it.</p>
        <p>Yeah, of course you could.</p>
        <p>I was, yeah, I was considering asking the question.</p>
        <p>You could ask the question as well.</p>
        <p>So I was, I was doing that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>I need, I need to register.</p>
        <p>So I might do that.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>I'm wondering if there's a, a stack overflow thing about it.</p>
        <p>I might have a look on them as well.</p>
        <p>But but yeah, that, that's, that's the only annoyance that I've really come across so far with with the
            fusion PBX
            stuff, which is is quite minor, But I I like, I like the the grid of colds you've got.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>That's, that's a good idea.</p>
        <p>The what?</p>
        <p>Sorry, the cor the corners.</p>
        <p>I like your, your coat.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>We can just get get ChatGPT, generate some scripts, or I'll just wing it.</p>
        <p>I was thinking it's, you know, often it's hot.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>It's hard to have a natural conversation when you're reading from a script.</p>
        <p>But maybe maybe like if we put together like a general script about what the topic of the conversation is and
            then
            you just, you talk about that in your own context.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>So like you, you have, you know, if for example, there's one about a sales person, one person just has to be
            be a
            customer, Doesn't they don't need a script.</p>
        <p>Does it need to be an agreeable customer or a disagreeable customer?</p>
        <p>The other person kind of needs to know what he's selling.</p>
        <p>But yeah, you could wing it to a certain extent and that'd be good to to compare different yeah summaries
            against it
            and see how they come out in comparison to each other.</p>
        <p>That's.</p>
        <p>OK, Yeah.</p>
        <p>Might also also be a good way to demo back to Simon, I guess in a controlled way.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I mean, ideally we'd, I mean, I, I can demo it sort of as is, but it's not, it's not, you know, end to
            end yet,
            which is annoying, but we can't really go into until Steve figures out his bit, which he's not had a chance
            to do
            because he's been doing BICOM stuff for half the week.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>You did mentioned some difficulties with with the caller ID because in like when it's a Yaling cut over
            Fusion, it
            doesn't create the caller ID or something.</p>
        <p>Yeah, there's.</p>
        <p>There's all sorts of difficulties depending on what's calling for and where you know where it's coming from.
        </p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>The scenario is yeah, yeah, right.</p>
        <p>So it depends on how he can sort of link, link the systems together to, to get something.</p>
        <p>He was thinking they've got an events table, which is where they're, they're doing stuff at the moment.</p>
        <p>So we're thinking maybe you could put stuff in there, but at the end of the day, what I need is a record with
            the
            conversation ID, the service ID or user ID and and the recording file name.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah, yes, yes, yeah.</p>
        <p>Because with the recording file name, I can I can call call the Fusion PBX to pick it up.</p>
        <p>So you know that, that, that would be pretty good.</p>
        <p>And the, I think my, my current thinking on it is he, he generates that puts it in a service bus queue.</p>
        <p>I pick it up of there, create a database record of that, fetch the file, kick it off.</p>
        <p>After it's done the transcriptions.</p>
        <p>It then needs to come back, pick up the data to find out who was on the call and then the police speaker one
            speaker
            2 with the actual names and then it does does the summary and would probably update the table.</p>
        <p>We say, you know have the stages in there as well and links back to the files which could then be available
            via the
            portal or or the app.</p>
        <p>So what the apps will want to do is we were thinking they know the conversation ID for a particular call that
            went
            out.</p>
        <p>And when a user clicks on the summary button, it goes and makes a call with that conversation ID to check if
            there is
            any information available, whether it's recording AI summary or transcriptions.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Yeah, well, yeah, even.</p>
        <p>So they're really they kind of goes and gets that based on the conversation ID basically.</p>
        <p>Even easier than that because they have the history list that knows the conversation ID when the recording,
            the
            transcriptions and the summary become available, we can just pep that across to them using signal R.</p>
        <p>And so so you know, they'll just get a little recordings ready to to to like on next to it or or flag next
            next to
            the the thing in the history.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Interesting.</p>
        <p>So not, not, not not was not was my thinking on it.</p>
        <p>And I mean, we could, we could be doing the same with with the portal.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, I think yeah, integrate which I I should start thinking about integrating signal out of course or
            just a
            simple thing that at least that first.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>I mean, I mean, I mean the, the simple things we could do with Signalr on the portal are the telephony
            platform
            updates.</p>
        <p>You know, when you when you say, you know, send it off, but you know, when I get this response back, I can
            just tell
            you it's done.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And so you don't you don't have to do the the refresh.</p>
        <p>I mean that, that would probably be the the first place.</p>
        <p>Good proof of.</p>
        <p>So yeah, sign up process, Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>But yeah, also with, you know, CDRS & up for yeah, all that sort of stuff.</p>
        <p>Yeah, this has been a 30 minute call, which is the longest one I've had.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>So why don't, why don't we try that and see how it goes?</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Good luck.</p>
        <p>OK, cheers.</p>
        <p>Let me know how it comes up.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I'll send.</p>
        <p>I'll send you alternative results.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>All right.</p>
        <p>OK, cheers.</p>
        <p>Cheers, mate.</p>
        <p>Bye.</p>
        <p>OK, bye.</p>
        <p>Bye.</p>
