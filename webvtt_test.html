        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>Hello, how are you doing?</p>
        <p>Hi, John.</p>
        <p>That's about how Are you sure?</p>
        <p>Not so bad, I just thought we if we have a sort of random conversation.</p>
        <p>Rather than a.</p>
        <p>Scripted 1 because that has more gaps and Ms and OS than than than a scripted 1.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, Yeah, I was, Yeah.</p>
        <p>So just.</p>
        <p>Go ahead.</p>
        <p>I was.</p>
        <p>Just if you could chat about anything really.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>I mean, just on the topic of, of putting a script together, I, I was, I put together a table.</p>
        <p>Let me share it with you in the chat.</p>
        <p>I've got it in my Notion document, but allow me to to screenshot it.</p>
        <p>So I was thinking something like what's on your screen at the moment, One key to back would be good.</p>
        <p>Like I created the matrix where it's 3 essentially 3 different topics of conversation and it's repeated
            between
            three different caller groups, so different voices.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And then it's repeated to have the same same conversation but the tone of it is negative and the topic of it
            is a
            little bit switched around.</p>
        <p>So for example, there could be a development discussion between 2 developers.</p>
        <p>The first one could be like them agreeing on the best way forward and agreeing on due date for task.</p>
        <p>And then the flipped version of that is a disagreement between 2 developers couldn't come to an agreement and
            just see how it handles the two variations.</p>
        <p>So maybe when Keith is back, we can kind of put together some recordings for that, that matrix of how many
            calls
            there 12312363 by 6 or 1818 voice recordings there.</p>
        <p>It's quite a lot.</p>
        <p>But that only makes sense once you've kind of automated your your pipeline flow a little bit to the so you
            don't
            have to keep their manual steps.</p>
        <p>Well, at the moment, well, Steve, still he's not time to work out how to, to get the conversation ID so we
            can
            attach it to the recording.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I mentioned that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And I've also just had a play around with the Fusion PBXAPI.</p>
        <p>Again, it's definitely not giving me a list of recordings, which is really annoying.</p>
        <p>Oh, but it but it it should, it's not giving something.</p>
        <p>So I don't know how we it should.</p>
        <p>It should.</p>
        <p>Yeah, OK.</p>
        <p>No, it's just I'm getting a 200 back from the call, but no, no data.</p>
        <p>But then it it quite often gives a 200 back from the call anyway, even if it's an invalid call, which is a
            bit
            annoying.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>So it's definitely something.</p>
        <p>That.</p>
        <p>We might need to talk to them about to see if there's an issue.</p>
        <p>OK.</p>
        <p>One thing that that Simon did did mention he wants us doing is, is talking to Fusion directly and building
            the
            conversa relationship with them.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, I might try give them a bail later or or you can just e-mail them.</p>
        <p>So that's probably something I'm gonna be more, more, more pushed by Simon.</p>
        <p>There was an API which Paul mentioned, Notes API, don't know if we came across that previously when you were
            looking at Fusion.</p>
        <p>No, Yeah, I mean, if it's only for a couple of particular queries and depending on how the data is getting
            stored, they're using a Postgres database.</p>
        <p>So look, look pretty good.</p>
        <p>I only looked at it very superficially, but apparently Paul, Paul's watched a few videos on him and it's
            basically it's around talking to Fusion and they streamline a lot of lot of things in that space.</p>
        <p>So Paul kind of asked the question is, can this help us in any way?</p>
        <p>And I said, and I promise that we'll look into it.</p>
        <p>It might might even be that, you know, you might find that there's no reason to use their API to build a
            platform, but it might be an interim step where OPS can use and points through Postman very quickly using
            the
            API to make changes.</p>
        <p>That's something that he was keen about.</p>
        <p>So setting up good.</p>
        <p>So I mean I could always write an API myself.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>That that.</p>
        <p>That goes into the post.</p>
        <p>You know, if it's, if it's, if it's just a couple of extra things which which the standard one doesn't give
            us.
        </p>
        <p>Well, I think the feeling was like without looking into in detail, can't answer it.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>But the kind of the question that Paul asked is obviously there's so much that OPS want to do to replicate
            the
            current setup and that's going to take your time to build and for us to put it in the portal.</p>
        <p>But if they are able to use this through Postman to very quickly make changes to, to, to fusion, you know,
            set up
            in groups or make changes to extension, then is there a possibility of doing that while we write our own
            APIs
            and then connect it up to the portal?</p>
        <p>So there's worth exploring at some point next week.</p>
        <p>I'll have a look.</p>
        <p>Did you, did you chat me the the name of it or was it in it?</p>
        <p>So.</p>
        <p>Was it in an e-mail?</p>
        <p>So it's in that, it's in the fusion document that I pushed out in the dev chat earlier in the week, which,
            Yeah,
            yeah.</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I, I, I remember seeing it somewhere.</p>
        <p>So.</p>
        <p>So there's some detail in that and I'll mention it to Keith tomorrow as well.</p>
        <p>It's in the future.</p>
        <p>I'll have I'll have a look at that then.</p>
        <p>So I hope might bring you out.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah.</p>
        <p>I'm quite annoyed that the the.</p>
        <p>Recording list one's not working because if I have the name of the of the file, I can the the I can download
            it
            using the API, it's just not.</p>
        <p>Letting me.</p>
        <p>Get a list of them.</p>
        <p>Is there anything that needs to be configured that that we've missed maybe?</p>
        <p>So it's a sort of.</p>
        <p>I don't, I don't think so.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yep.</p>
        <p>So yeah, it would be good to.</p>
        <p>I'll have I'll have a look at the the.</p>
        <p>Extra API but it.</p>
        <p>Would it's.</p>
        <p>It's quite annoying that the API is not working, so I will try reaching out to Fusion and see seeing if they
            can
            tell me where I'm going wrong because I'm basically copying the the exact call that's in the example and
            it's
            not working, which is annoying.</p>
        <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, Skip, there is.</p>
        <p>But yeah, that aside, it's, it's pretty good.</p>
        <p>I don't know if you keep sharing it with you, but there was a PBX forum specifically around Fusion where
            people
            were posting questions.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I've, yeah, I've had to look on that.</p>
        <p>There's there's no, there's nothing about it.</p>
        <p>Yeah, of course you could.</p>
        <p>I was, yeah, I was considering asking the question.</p>
        <p>You could ask the question as well.</p>
        <p>So I was, I was doing that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>I need, I need to register.</p>
        <p>So I might do that.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>I'm wondering if there's a Stack Overflow thing about it.</p>
        <p>I might have a look on them as well.</p>
        <p>But but yeah, that that's that's the only annoyance that I've really come.</p>
        <p>Across.</p>
        <p>So far with with the Fusion PBX stuff which is is quite minor.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>But I I like I like the the.</p>
        <p>Grid of colds you've got that's that's a good idea I.</p>
        <p>The what?</p>
        <p>Sorry, the cor the corners.</p>
        <p>Like your?</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Your coat we can just get get ChatGPT, generate some scripts or I'll just wing it.</p>
        <p>I was thinking, you know, often it's hot.</p>
        <p>It's hot.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>It's hard to have a natural conversation when you're reading from a script.</p>
        <p>But maybe, maybe like if we put together like a general script about what the topic of the conversation is
            and
            then you just, you talk about that in your own context.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>So like you, you have, you know, if for example, there's one about a sales person, one person just has to be
            be a
            customer doesn't they don't need a script because it needs to be an agreeable customer or a disagreeable
            customer.</p>
        <p>The other person kind of needs to know what he's selling.</p>
        <p>But yeah, you could wing it to a certain extent and that'd be good to to compare different yeah summaries
            against
            it and see how they come out in comparison to each other.</p>
        <p>That's OK.</p>
        <p>Might also also be a good way to demo back to Simon, I guess in a controlled way.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah.</p>
        <p>I mean, ideally we'd, I mean, I, I can demo it sort of as is, but it's not, it's not, you know, end to end.
        </p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Which is annoying, but we can't really go into until Steve figures out his bit, which he's not the chance to
            do
            because he's been doing Bicom stuff for half the week.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>You did mentioned some difficulties with with the caller ID because in like when it's a Yaling over Fusion,
            it
            doesn't create the caller ID or something.</p>
        <p>Yeah, there's, there's all sorts of difficulties depending on what's calling for and where, you know, where
            it's
            coming from.</p>
        <p>Yeah, the scenario, yes.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah, right.</p>
        <p>So it depends on how he can sort of link, link the systems together to, to get something.</p>
        <p>He was thinking, they've got an events table, which is where they're, they're doing stuff at the moment.</p>
        <p>So we're thinking maybe you could put stuff in there, but at the end of the day, what I need is a record with
            the
            conversation ID, the service ID or user ID and and the recording file name.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Yep.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah.</p>
        <p>Because with the recording file name I can I can call call the Fusion PBX to.</p>
        <p>Pick it.</p>
        <p>Up.</p>
        <p>SO you know that that that would be pretty good.</p>
        <p>Yes, yes, yeah.</p>
        <p>And the I.</p>
        <p>Think my.</p>
        <p>My current thinking on it is he he generates that puts it in a service bus queue, I pick it up of the create
            a
            database record of that, fetch the file, kick it off.</p>
        <p>After it's done the transcriptions it then needs to come back, pick up the data to find out who was on the
            call
            and then the police speaker one speaker 2 with the actual names and then it does does the summary and would
            probably update.</p>
        <p>The table to say.</p>
        <p>You know, have the stages in there as well and links back to the files, which could then be available via the
            portal or or the app.</p>
        <p>So what the apps will want to do is we were thinking they know the conversation ID for a particular call that
            went out.</p>
        <p>And when a user clicks on the summary button, it goes and makes a call with that conversation ID to check if
            there is any information available, whether it's recording AI summary or transcriptions.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah.</p>
        <p>So they're really an API that goes and gets that based on the conversation ID, basically.</p>
        <p>Well, yeah, even.</p>
        <p>Even easier than that, because they have the history list that knows the conversation ID when the recording,
            the
            transcriptions and the summary become available, we can just pip that across to them using Signal R And so
            so
            you know, they'll just get a little recordings ready to to, to like on next to it or, or.</p>
        <p>Flag.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah.</p>
        <p>Next next to the the thing in the history so not not not not was not was my thinking on it.</p>
        <p>Interesting.</p>
        <p>And I mean, we could, we could be doing the same with, with the portal.</p>
        <p>Yeah, Yeah, I think, yeah, integrate.</p>
        <p>I should start thinking about integrating signal.</p>
        <p>Just a simple thing that I need to start first.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>I mean, I mean, I mean the, the, the simple things we could do with Signalr on the portal are the telephony
            platform updates.</p>
        <p>You know, when you when you say, you know, send it off, when I get this response back, I can just tell you
            it's
            done.</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>And so you don't, you don't have to do the, the refresh.</p>
        <p>I mean that that would probably be the first place.</p>
        <p>Good proof of.</p>
        <p>So yeah, sign up process, Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>But yeah, also with, you know, CDRS & up for, yeah, all that sort of stuff.</p>
        <p>Yeah, this has been a 15 minute call, which is the longest one I've had.</p>
        <p>Cool.</p>
        <p>So why don't, why don't we try that and see how it goes?</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p>Good luck.</p>
        <p>OK, Cheers.</p>
        <p>Let me know how it comes up.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I'll send.</p>
        <p>I'll send you.</p>
        <p>I'll send you the results.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>All right.</p>
        <p>OK, Cheers.</p>
        <p>Cheers, mate.</p>
        <p>Bye.</p>
        <p>OK, bye.</p>
        <p>Bye.</p>
